# Sebcon24

This is the Angular example application of the book [Angular - Programmieren f√ºr Einsteiger](https://www.angular-buch.net), called _sebcon24_. It's a basic ecommerce plattform, where you can:

- see the product list,
- see product details
- search for a specific product
- add the product to the cart
- see the cart content (selected products)
- order the cart content

Here you can see the product list.
